# newmodels_reborn

This is an MTA resource which makes use of the [engineRequestModel](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/EngineRequestModel) features to add new peds (skins), vehicles and objects:

- place your mods (dff/txd/col files) in designated folders that are automatically detected by the script
- the system syncs all added models with all players
- it's minimalistic, optimized and robust

In simpler terms, with this resource you can make scripts/change your scripts to add new skin, vehicle and object IDs to your server! For example, we can now add all SA-MP objects.
