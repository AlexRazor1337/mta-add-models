# `Newmodels v5 Azul üíô`

This MTA resource makes use of the clientside allocated models ([engineRequestModel](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/EngineRequestModel) and related features) to add new peds (skins), vehicles and objects:

- place your mods (dff/txd/col files) in designated folders that are automatically detected
- the system syncs all added models with all players
- use a simple trick in your existing scripts to work with the new model IDs
- it's minimalistic, optimized and robust

With this resource you can make scripts or change your existing scripts to add new skin, vehicle and object IDs to your server! For example, you may add all SA-MP object models!

## Older versions

It is easy to migrate to v5 from newmodels v4 (not from v3; the architecture of that version is no longer used). The **models folder structure remains the same**, but the scripts have changed in the way models are applied to elements.

This resource no longer uses and relies on the **MTA Element Data system** (`setElementData`) to sync the models to all clients! Instead, newmodels makes use of Lua tables and MTA events. This major change was made to **improve performance** and control the sync of models more efficiently.
